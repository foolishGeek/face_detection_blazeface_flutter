# 🧠 Flutter Face Detection App Overview

## 📦 Imports & Dependencies
- 'dart:io': Provides I/O functionality for file operations 📁
- 'dart:math': Offers mathematical functions like max() used in IoU calculations 📐 [[3]](https://pub.dev/packages/image )
- 'package:flutter/material.dart': Core Flutter framework for Material Design UIs 🎨 [[2]](https://pub.dev/packages/camera )
- 'package:camera/camera.dart': Plugin to control camera hardware (preview, capture) 📸 [[1]](https://pub.dev/packages/camera )
- 'package:tflite_flutter/tflite_flutter.dart': For running TensorFlow Lite models on Android/iOS 🤖 [[6]](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter )
- 'package:image/image.dart' as img: Dart image library for decoding/encoding and transformations 🖼️ [[3]](https://pub.dev/packages/image )

## 🌐 Global Variables
- `List<CameraDescription> cameras = []`: Stores available device cameras 📷
- `Future<void> main() async`: Initializes the app, fetches camera descriptions, and runs MyApp 🚀

## 🏠 MyApp Class
- Root widget of the application 🏗️
- Returns `BlazeFaceScreen` as the home screen 🖥️ [[9]](https://pub.dev/documentation/camera/latest/ )

## 📐 BoundingBox Class
- Represents a rectangular area around a detected face 🔲
- Contains coordinates (`xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax`, `ymax`) and confidence score 📊

## 👁️ BlazeFaceScreen Class
- A `StatefulWidget` managing state for face detection 🔄
- Contains:
  - `CameraController controller`: Manages camera lifecycle 📷
  - `Interpreter interpreter`: Loads and runs TFLite model 🧠
  - `Variables` for results display, bounding boxes, and image data 📦

## ⚙️ Lifecycle Methods
### initState()
- Initializes camera and loads TFLite model 🛠️

### initializeCamera()
- Sets up back-facing camera and initializes controller 📷 [[1]](https://pub.dev/documentation/camera/latest/ )

### loadModel()
- Loads `blazeface.tflite` model for face detection 🤖 [[2]](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter )

## 🧮 Mathematical Functions
### sigmoid(double x)
- Converts raw scores into probabilities between 0 and 1 📈

### iou(BoundingBox a, BoundingBox b)
- Calculates Intersection over Union (IoU), measuring overlap between two boxes 📐 [[5]](https://pub.dev/documentation/camera/latest/ )

### nonMaximumSuppression(List<BoundingBox> boxes)
- Removes overlapping bounding boxes using IoU thresholding 🧹 [[5]](https://pub.dev/documentation/camera/latest/ )

## 🧪 Face Detection Logic
### runBlazeFace(img.Image? image)
- Processes input image and feeds it into the model 📊
  - Resizes image to 128x128 pixels for model compatibility 📏 [[6]](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter )
  - Normalizes pixel values to range [0, 1] 🧽
  - Runs inference using interpreter 🚀
  - Extracts bounding boxes and confidence scores from outputs 📐
  - Applies NMS to filter out overlapping boxes 🧹 [[6]](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter )

## 📸 Image Capture and Detection
### captureAndDetect()
- Captures image using camera, rotates it, and runs face detection 🔄
  - Clears previous results 🧹
  - Captures image using `takePicture()` 📸
  - Decodes image using `img.decodeImage()` 🖼️ [[1]](https://pub.dev/documentation/camera/latest/ )
  - Iterates through rotated versions for better accuracy 🔄
  - Updates UI with results 📋

## 🖥️ UI Components
### 📺 Camera Preview
- Displays live feed using `CameraPreview(controller)` 📷 [[1]](https://pub.dev/documentation/camera/latest/ )

### 📸 Capture Button
- Triggers `captureAndDetect()` when pressed ⚡

### 📊 Results Display
- Shows detected faces, confidence scores, and bounding boxes 📈
- Uses `ListView.builder` to show each processed image and its results 📅 [[9]](https://pub.dev/documentation/camera/latest/ )

## 🔧 Key Dependencies
### Flutter Camera Plugin
- For accessing camera hardware and displaying previews 📷 [[1]](https://pub.dev/packages/camera )

### TFLite Flutter
- For running TensorFlow Lite models on mobile devices 🤖 [[6]](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter )

### Image Package
- For image manipulation tasks like resizing and encoding 🖼️ [[3]](https://pub.dev/packages/image )

## 📝 Summary
This Flutter app integrates:
- ✅ Camera capture 📷
- ✅ TensorFlow Lite-based face detection using BlazeFace 🤖
- ✅ Real-time result visualization 📊

It demonstrates how to use:
- 📦 `camera`
